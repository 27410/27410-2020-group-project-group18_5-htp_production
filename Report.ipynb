    "5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP) is a derivative of tryptophan, which has a hydroxy group at position 5. It is a precursor to serotonin and the hormone melatonin. 5-HTP is used for treating indivudals that have disorders due to impaired serotonin production. This is in particular psychiatric disorders, such as depression and anxiety, but has also shown to have an effect as an appetite surpressor and sleeping aid. 5-HTP is usually extracted from the seeds of the African plant *Griffonia simplicifolia*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conversion of L-tryptophan to 5-HTP by L-tryptophan hydroxylase (TPH), is the slowest, or rate-limiting step in the synthesis of serotonin. The enzyme adds a hydroxyl (OH) group onto the 5 position of L-tryptophan. Subsequent conversion of 5-HTP to serotonin (5-HT) happens in the nervous tissue and liver and is achieved by the activity of the enzyme Aromatic Amino Acid Decarboxylase (AAAD), which removes a carboxyl group from 5-HTP. Vitamin B6 works as a coenzyme is this reaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "***5-HTP biosynthetic pathway***\n",
    "\n",
    "5-HTP, the precursor of serotonin and melatonin, is produced from L-tryptophan by enzyme tryptophan 5-hydroxylase (T5H), while in plants the serotonin production takes place through another intermediate, tryptamine, by decarboxylation of L-tryptophan. T5H from human and animals requires cofactors 5,6,7,8-tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) and Fe2+, and O2 as a co-substrate. Upon hydroxylation of tryptophan, BH4 is oxidised to pterin-4α-carbinolamine and regenerated back to BH4 by pterin-4α-carbinolamine dehydratase and dihydropteridine reductase.\n",
    "Family of pterin-dependent amino acid hydroxylases also includes phenylalanine 4-hydroxylases (P4H). While T5H are not found in bacteria and their expression in bacterial cell factories is rather complicated due to solubility issues and lack of a native cofactor, P4H are present in many prokaryotes and can be engineered to accept tryptophan instead of phenylalanine as their substrate. Bacterial P4H use an alternative cofactor tetrahydromonapterin (MH4), and many bacteria possess the full set of genes responsible for generation and regeneration of MH4 (Cao et al., 2020). "

    "*Escherichia coli* is a gram negative, facultative anaerobic bacterium commonly found in the lower intestine. Most *E. coli* strains are harmless, however the genus also contains some pathotypes which can cause a variety of diseases [Kaper et al. 2004]. *E. coli* is a very frequently used cell factory host, due to its well-developed genomic tools which make genetic manipulation relatively easy. Furthermore it grows fast in minimal salts medium and is able to utilize a wide range of inexpensive substrates. A considerable bottleneck in exploiting *E. coli* as a cell factory host for production of proteins is the formation of aggregates of overexpressed protein which complicates and adds to the cost of downstream processing of the final product.\n",
    "\n",
    "Several metabolic engineering steps need to be performed in order to utilize *E. coli* as a cell factory for the production of 5-HTP. *E. coli* naturally produces L-Tryptophan, though a pathway  that can be further optimized by decreasing acetate production in the cell factory strain [Liu et al. 2016]. However, it does not contain the genes necessary for the final conversion of L-Trp into 5-HTP.\n",
    "In plants, L-Trp is decorboxylated into tryptamine and hydroxylated into 5-HTP by tryptophan 5-hydroxylase (T5H). T5H uses 5,6,7,8-tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) and Fe2+ as a cofactor, *E. coli* does not naturally synthesize BH4 but it is able to use tetrahydromonapterin (MH4) as an alternative co-factor. However, the regeneration system of MH4 is not fully available in *E. coli* which means this have to be heterologous incorporated in the organism before it can be used for continuous 5-HTP production [Cao et al. 2020].

    "Apart from E.coli, the second cell factory, in which the 5-HTP production pathway was introduced, is B.subtilis. It is an aerobic, gram-positive soil bacterium, commonly used in production of enzymes, vitamins, peptides and even pharmaceuticals [Su et al. 2020]. \n",
    "\n",
    "The wide range of usage of B.subtilis in biotechnology can be justified by its many advantages, like excellent protein secretion ability, highly adaptable metabolism, short fermentation cycle (48h), and use of cheap substrates for the cultivation [Su et al 2020]. What distinguishes B.subitlis from cell factory described above is having single cell membrane and three distinguished secretion pathways, which makes extraction of the compound of interest much easier and lowers the costs of downstream processing. Moreover, B.subtilis is an organism generally recognized as safe (GRAS), in contrast to E.coli, which some strains have pathogenic lifestyle and their genes spread through horizontal transfer. B.subtilis is so popular and widely studied organism, that is possess its own database (SubtiWiki) with all known pathways, genes and their expression, protein interactions and pathway regulations [Juhas 2014]. Genetic modifications are easily performed on this organism, due to development of many genetic tools. [Su et al. 2020]. \n",
    "\n",
    "Apart from many advantages of using B.subtilis as the cell factory, the organism pose some challenges that must be taken into consideration when designing and modifying it for production of compound of interest. B.subtilis is known from having many intra- and extracellular peptidase activities, that very often cleave proteins into constituent amino acids [Desmond et al. 1975]. Moreover, some researchers report difficulties with introducing foreign genetic information into the organism [Ferierra et al. 2015]. Even though this is not a concern in this project, it must be addressed when the organism will be genetically modified in the laboratory. Lastly, the operon for the production of tryptophan in B.subtilis is regulated by attenuation mechanism, so possibility of more depth modifications will be required to obtain satisfying product yields [Gollnick et al. 1994].\n",
    "\n",
    "B.subtilis already has tryptophan synthesis pathway, which is a precursor for 5-HTP, therefore only last part of this pathway needs to be introduced into the organism. What’s more, the 5-hydroxytryptophan is not a protein, so it won’t be degraded by peptidases present internally or externally in B.subtilis. The organism itself is cheap in cultivation, which is an advantage in last part – actual fermentation and production. Its genes and their function were thoroughly studied, so genetic modifications and their consequences can be better predicted. Important for this particular project is the fact that genome scale model of B.subtilis already exists, so production predictions can be already assessed. \n",
    "\n",
    "Because of the complicated and highly controlled tryptophan synthesis pathway genetic engineering of B.subtilis for production of 5-HTP will require more modification and introduction of more metabolic pathways than in E.coli, however, if the model predictions show ability of this bacteria to produce the compound of interest, the industrial production and downstream processing seems to be easier than for E.coli, due to its already existing secreting system, non-pathogenical character, cheap substrates and short fermentation cycle. \n",
    "\n",
    "For both B.subtilis and E.coli, current research aims to generate minimal cell factory for industrial applications, which makes it even more attractive candidate for 5-HTP production [Juhas et al. 2014]."

    "The global 5-HTP market is expected to grow in the near future due to increasing stress and depression levels in the general population. Especially hormonal changes and improper diet is thought to contribute to decreasing serotonin levels over the coming years [GVR Industry report 2019]. Current commercial production of 5-HTP relies on its extraction from the seeds of the African plant *Griffonia simplicifolia*. Thus, the production is depended on season and growth conditions which can greatly influence the cost-effective production. The current downstream processing of 5-HTP from the seeds includes harvesting by hand and drying of the seeds in West Africa. Afterwards the seeds are transported to Asia where 5-HTP is industrially extracted leaving the remainder of the plant as waste [Kim et al. 2009]. Methods for chemical synthesis of the compound has been proposed. However, thus far this production has not shown to be economically feasible [Mora-Villalobos et al. 2018].\n",
    "\n",
    "By constructing a cell factory capable of producing 5-HTP, the cost-efficiency would greatly increase as substrate costs and waste will decrease. The cell factory can be grown in large fermentation tanks which consumes less space than the agricultural areas required for growth of the plant *S. simplicifolia*. Season independence will allow for reliable distribution of 5-HTP to costumers and consumers securing cheap and efficient treatment of serotonin deficiency and related diseases.\n"

The missing components of the cofactor MH4 synthesis and regeneration pathway will also be introduced. For E. coli, MH4 synthesis genes can already be found, however, the regeneration pathway consisting of two genes is missing.
