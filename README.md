# 27410 - Group assignment - Group 18 - Designing a bacterial cell factory for the production of 5-hydroxytryptophan

## Project summary 
The overall aim of the project is to construct a metabolic model of a bacterial cell factory capable of 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP) production. During the project, two possible host organisms were presented, *Bacillus subtilis* and *Escherichia Coli*. A well curated model was found for each host, and the necessary pathways were added to each model in order to facilitate 5-HTP production.

## Project overview
The main part of this project can be viewed in the [Report.ipynb](Report.ipynb) document. Here we have presented the background knowledge of the project, as well as the results and discussions of our findings. Methods will be briefly described, however, sometimes several lines of code and calculation was necessary, this have been computed in separate files, which will be linked in the [Report.ipynb](Report.ipynb) document when relevant. All models and data sheets necessary for the analysis performed in this project can be found in the `data` folder. Necessary requirements for this repository can be found in [requirements.txt](requirements.txt).

## What we achieved
We achieved creating two cell factory models able to produce 5-HTP for industrial processes. Both models were analysed and optimized for maximum possible production, while keeping the positive growth rate. Based on the results from the analysis, the possible suggestions for further improvements were presented. Detailed descriptions of the result's discussion and conclusions can be found in the [Report.ipynb](Report.ipynb)
